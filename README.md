BMI Calculator Project Summary :

Objective:
To build a simple Python-based application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user based on their weight and height, and classifies them into standard health categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).

Steps Performed:

Collected user inputs for weight and height.

Applied the BMI formula:

𝐵
𝑀
𝐼
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI=
height (m)
2
weight (kg)
	​


Added input validation to ensure only positive and numeric values are accepted.

Classified BMI results into categories using conditional statements.

Displayed the BMI value along with the health category.

Tools & Technologies Used :

Language: Python

IDE/Editor: VS Code

Concepts Applied: Functions, Conditional Statements, Exception Handling, User Input Validation

Outcome:

Successfully developed a working BMI Calculator.

Learned practical implementation of Python basics like functions, error handling, conditionals.

Gained experience in writing user-friendly and interactive command-line applications.
